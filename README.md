Our dataset that we used for this project is called "Heart Disease Mortality Data Among US Adults (35+) by State/Territory and County 2019-2021 and can be found by following this link (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/heart-disease-mortality-data-among-us-adults-35-by-state-territory-and-county-2019-2021).

## References for any code used that is not your own

To complete the folium map of counties, we used a geojson from this [source](https://gist.github.com/sdwfrost/d1c73f91dd9d175998ed166eb216994a?short_path=bd97547).

We also reference [this article on folium](https://www.earthdatascience.org/tutorials/introduction-to-leaflet-animated-maps/) and had Xpert Learning assist help with refining our code and identifying syntax errors. To run the maps in the <!-- insert final file name here --> took about 8 minutes per map, so finding the correct code before running all of the notebook code was important.

We used this [website](https://waldyrious.net/viridis-palette-generator/) for identifying a color scale for our maps. It was very helpful because you could choose a scheme and then indicate how many colors you needed.
